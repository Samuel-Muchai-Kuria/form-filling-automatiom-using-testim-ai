# Project Title: Automated Form Testing on Testim AI with Vercel Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the automation capabilities of [Testim.ai](https://www.testim.io/) for form submission processes, using a form hosted on Vercel. It covers the entire process from form creation and data entry simulation to scheduled test execution and result monitoring, making use of Testim’s various automation features.

## Project Structure

### Form Creation
The form was created on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and includes a range of fields commonly found in web forms, such as:
- Text inputs (e.g., name, email)
- Select options
- Checkboxes and radio buttons
- File upload option
- Other custom fields as required for typical form submissions
The link of the form is : [Vercel form](https://form-builder-x.vercel.app/forms/85c0a195784)

### Automation with Testim AI
Using Testim.ai, we automated the testing of this form to ensure consistency in data submission, validation, and responsiveness. This involved:
- Configuring test cases to handle typical form data inputs.
- Using Testim’s visual editor to set up test steps without needing to code.
- Setting up conditional tests and loops for data entry validation across multiple input fields.
- Scheduling regular tests to run at specified intervals.

### Scheduled Testing
Scheduled testing was configured on Testim.ai to automatically run the form tests at intervals. This allows for ongoing monitoring and error-checking, ensuring that the form performs as expected under different test conditions over time.

### Test Results & Images
The results and logs from each test were collected, with images of the test executions provided for visual reference. These images demonstrate the success and stability of the automated testing setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Testim.ai account.
- Vercel account (if you wish to replicate the form setup).
- You are free to use an already created form.

### Running Tests
1. Access Testim.ai and navigate to the project.
2. Run individual tests manually or set up scheduled tests for automation.
3. You can optionally use the recording function provided.
4. View test outcomes, including screenshots and logs, from the Testim dashboard.

### Dependencies
- Testim AI: For automation and scheduled testing
- Vercel: For form hosting

## Conclusion
This project provided an in-depth exploration of Testim AI’s capabilities for form automation. The combination of Vercel’s serverless form hosting and Testim’s powerful automation features demonstrated an effective solution for automated testing and validation.
